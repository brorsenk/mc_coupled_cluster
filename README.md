Multicomponent Coupled Cluster

Alpha implementation of multicomponent coupled cluster with single and double excitations (see: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01120).

Requires PySCF and Cython.

Currently in the process of refactoring the code to make it more user friendly. As of right now, the program starts in cc.py, which is where the molecule gets defined as well.
